    <!-- Description -->
    <p>
      This spaghetti with red clam sauce is one of my 'go to' recipes and it
      takes only <br />
      about 15 minutes from start to finish. The only prep work really is
      mashing the <br />
      garlic. The sauce is great on any pasta, but I prefer angel hair or
      spaghetti.

      <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 (24 ounce) jar tomato pasta sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>1 cup good-quality crisp white wine</li>
      <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams, drained with juice reserved</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pound dry spaghetti</li>
      <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>fresh basil leaves or flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Steps -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour olive oil into cold skillet. Add garlic, capers, anchovy paste, and
        <br />
        red pepper flakes. Place over medium heat; cook and stir until oil
        <br />
        infused with flavors, about 5 minutes, taking care not to brown garlic.
        <br />
        Add tomato sauce; rinse jar with 1/4 cup water and add to skillet. Add
        <br />
        wine and juice from clams, reserving clams; bring to a simmer until
        <br />
        slightly reduced and thickened, 7 to 9 minutes. <br />
      </li>

      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        <br />
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until nearly tender yet firm to
        <br />
        the bite, about 1 minute less than directed on package for al dente.
        <br />
        Drain. Return spaghetti to the pot off heat. <br />
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir in clams. Pour sauce over spaghetti; stir. Cover the pot; let sit,
        <br />
        off heat, to allow spaghetti to absorb some sauce, about 3 minutes. Stir
        <br />
        in Parmesan cheese; top with chopped fresh basil and/or parsley. <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
