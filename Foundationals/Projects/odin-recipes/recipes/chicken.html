    <!-- Description -->
    <p>
      This roasted chicken is perfectly seasoned and just like the way my <br />
      grandmother used to make it. The method used in this recipe results in the
      <br />
      juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked.
      <br />

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Chicken:</b> This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your
        <br />
        bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Seasonings:</b> This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt,
        <br />
        black pepper, and onion powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Butter:</b> Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings <br />
        something to adhere to.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Celery:</b> Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal
        <br />
        flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken
        <br />
        cooks.
      </li>
    </ul>
