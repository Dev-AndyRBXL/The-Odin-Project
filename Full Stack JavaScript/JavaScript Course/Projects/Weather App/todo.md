# Description

- You should be able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
- You should change the look of the page based on the dat (You could even use the Giphy API to find appropriate weather-related gifs and display them.)

## Assignment

- Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files. *DONE*
- Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information. *CURRENT*

- Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
  Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).

- Display the information on your webpage!
  While you don’t have to, if you wish to display weather icons then there can be a lot of them to import, so have a look at the dynamic import() function. Unlike plain template strings without an import, Webpack can read dynamic imports and still bundle all the relevant assets.

- Add any styling you like!

* Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to simulate network speeds.
